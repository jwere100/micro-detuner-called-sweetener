One of main obstacles many amateurs face in the mixing stage is the lack of "variance" or "feel" in a track. Digital audio, especially in home-studio workflows, often sounds static, overly clean, and harmonically "flat". If you've ever watched a professional mixer or engineer work, you'll seem them utilize industry-grade plugins, which include spectral exciters, shapers, saturators, etc. These plugins contain underlying modifiers that create difference in tone, enhance harmonics, and introduce micro-movements into the audio. This often leads many engineers to describe certain plugins to have a certain effect or sound, such as "gluing" the vocals to the track or "lifting" the vocals up. Without these micro-variations, a mix doesn’t feel “finished" or "professional". Often times, this phenomena is what seperates an amateurs mix from a professional mix.
